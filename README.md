# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Advanced Web Interface

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that monitors network traffic, detects suspicious activities, and provides real-time alerts. It combines **signature-based detection** with **anomaly-based detection** using machine learning techniques. The system is equipped with a modern web interface for easy interaction and visualization of data.
